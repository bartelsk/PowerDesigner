## Prerequisites
Before starting any of the samples, refer to the prerequisites in the [README](../../README.md) file in the root of this repository.

Configure the [App.config](App.config) file in this folder to point to the proper PowerDesigner repository as well. The configuration file contains information on the appropriate repository definition and user account which are used to connect to the repository.

## Running the samples
All samples are set up as tests that can be run by the built-in `Test Explorer` of Visual Studio. If the `Test Explorer` window is not visible, go to the `VIEW` menu and click `Test Explorer`.

Some samples assume the presence of certain users and/or groups, so do not run all tests at once! The samples are self-contained; you should first create the sample user before retrieving its properties, for example. There is no dependency on any existing user or group.
